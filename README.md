# Bring-a-Trailor
# This is a project to learn web scraping and to generate a data set. The data of interest is generated from online classic/entusiast car auctions. Once the data has been gathered for a particular make and model the data will be quiried using some sort of SQL and presented with something like Power BI or Tableau. Please see Wiki page for more information and links.
